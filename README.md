## About
**A WhatsApp API client optimized for Electron applications**

wwebjs-electron is a fork of whatsapp-web.js specifically optimized for use with Electron applications. It works seamlessly with puppeteer-in-electron to provide a native desktop WhatsApp experience. The library connects through WhatsApp Web using Puppeteer within Electron's BrowserView, providing access to all WhatsApp Web features while maintaining the security and performance benefits of Electron.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.**

## Installation

The module is now available on npm! `npm i wwebjs-electron`

### Required Dependencies for Electron Integration

For proper Electron integration, you also need to install these dependencies:

```bash
npm i wwebjs-electron puppeteer-core puppeteer-in-electron
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Node ``v18+`` is required.**

## QUICK STEPS TO UPGRADE NODE

### Windows

#### Manual
Just get the latest LTS from the [official node website][nodejs].

#### npm
```powershell
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
```

#### Choco
```powershell
choco install nodejs-lts
```

#### Winget
```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

### Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - &&\
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Example usage

### Basic Electron Implementation

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow, BrowserView } = require('electron');
const { Client, LocalAuth } = require('wwebjs-electron');
const pie = require('puppeteer-in-electron');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');

// Initialize puppeteer-in-electron
pie.initialize(app);

app.whenReady().then(async () => {
    // Create main window
    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 1200,
        height: 800,
        webPreferences: {
            nodeIntegration: false,
            contextIsolation: true
        }
    });

    // Connect browser
    const browser = await pie.connect(app, puppeteer);

    // Create BrowserView for WhatsApp
    const whatsappView = new BrowserView({
        webPreferences: {
            nodeIntegration: false,
            contextIsolation: true,
            webSecurity: false
        }
    });

    // Get Puppeteer page from BrowserView
    const page = await pie.getPage(browser, whatsappView);

    // Set user agent
    await page.setUserAgent(
        'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
    );

    // Create WhatsApp client using the Puppeteer page
    const client = new Client({
        authStrategy: new LocalAuth(),
        page: page
    });

    client.on('qr', (qr) => {
        console.log('QR RECEIVED', qr);
        // Display QR code to user
    });

    client.on('ready', () => {
        console.log('WhatsApp Client is ready!');
    });

    client.on('message', async (msg) => {
        if (msg.body === '!ping') {
            await msg.reply('ü§ñ Pong!');
        }
    });

    // Add BrowserView to window
    mainWindow.addBrowserView(whatsappView);
    mainWindow.setBrowserView(whatsappView);
    
    // Set BrowserView bounds
    const { width, height } = mainWindow.getContentBounds();
    whatsappView.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width, height });

    // Initialize client
    await client.initialize();
});
```

### Standalone Usage (Compatible with original whatsapp-web.js)

```js
const { Client, LocalAuth } = require('wwebjs-electron');

const client = new Client({
    authStrategy: new LocalAuth()
});

client.on('qr', (qr) => {
    console.log('QR RECEIVED', qr);
});

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('Client is ready!');
});

client.on('message', msg => {
    if (msg.body == '!ping') {
        msg.reply('pong');
    }
});

client.initialize();
```

## Key Differences from whatsapp-web.js

wwebjs-electron provides several enhancements specifically designed for Electron applications:

- **Native Electron Integration**: Works seamlessly with Electron's BrowserView and BrowserWindow
- **puppeteer-in-electron Support**: Optimized to work with puppeteer-in-electron for better performance
- **Enhanced Security**: Maintains Electron's security model while providing full WhatsApp functionality  
- **Desktop-First Design**: Built specifically for desktop applications rather than web browsers
- **Improved Resource Management**: Better memory and CPU usage in Electron environments
- **Custom User Agent Support**: Easy configuration for desktop-specific user agents

### Installation with Electron

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install wwebjs-electron puppeteer-core puppeteer-in-electron
   ```

2. Initialize puppeteer-in-electron in your main process:
   ```js
   const pie = require('puppeteer-in-electron');
   pie.initialize(app);
   ```

3. Use the provided Electron integration pattern as shown in the examples above.

### Recommended Versions

For optimal compatibility, use these specific versions:

```json
{
  "wwebjs-electron": "^1.33.2",
  "puppeteer-core": "^24.19.0", 
  "puppeteer-in-electron": "^3.0.5"
}
```

These versions have been tested together and provide the most stable experience.
